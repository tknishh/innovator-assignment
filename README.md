- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- MySQL (or your preferred database)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd innovator-assignment
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Update the .env file with your database credentials and other configurations

# Initialize the database
flask db upgrade

# Run the backend server
python run.py
```

The backend server will start at `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The frontend application will start at `http://localhost:3000`
